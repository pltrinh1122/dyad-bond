# dyad-bond — Carry-Forward Ledger

> **Live in-flight state. Read this right after the anchor (`AGENT.md`, booted via the
> `CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md` shim) to resume.** Single home for open
> items; close them here as they clear. Written 2026-05-30 at bootstrap hand-off, because the

## How to resume (fresh session)
1. Load the anchor — the harness shim (`CLAUDE.md` or `GEMINI.md`) boots **`AGENT.md`** (the
   load-bearing content). Operate as **Covalent**.
2. Read this ledger.
3. **Reload the Bond-disciplines** (the index below) — these are *behavioral guards*, not reference;
   apply them at every seam. They live in `relationship-craft.md` but are indexed here because **the
   resume protocol doesn't load that file** — without this index they don't reload (see `ingraining.md`).
4. **ROM-UI check** *(→ `rom-ui.md`)* — compare the anchor to the **ROM-baseline** below
   (`git log -1 --format=%h -- AGENT.md` vs recorded; shims `CLAUDE.md GEMINI.md` in the watch set).
   **Mismatch → notify the Operator what changed in the operating baseline, then refresh the baseline
   line.** Match → silent (lightest anchor).
5. Take the **NBA** at the bottom.

> **ROM-baseline (anchor commit the running baseline reflects):** `4230357` — *Shim-layer (F-b):
> `AGENT.md` load-bearing; `CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md` boot-shims + birth-id caveat*. Update this line
> whenever `AGENT.md` (or a shim) changes.
> **RESTART-PENDING: CLEARED (s5 Stand-Up, 2026-06-01) — F-b VERIFIED at the harness level.** This
> session booted on the *shim* `CLAUDE.md`@`4230357` (the injected project-instructions are the boot-shim
> form — IDENTITY CAVEAT + harness overlay pointing to `dialectic/`, **not** the pre-shim full anchor);
> the shim's "*Read `AGENT.md` immediately*" was the actual mechanism that loaded the content home
> (`AGENT.md` was **not** auto-injected — read because the shim said to). Boot-chain `CLAUDE.md → Read
> AGENT.md` **fired → F-b not refuted.** ROM-UI: anchor + both shims all at `4230357` = baseline → **MATCH**.
> *(Soft-dependency caveat: the inject is automatic; the "Read AGENT.md" hop relies on the agent obeying
> the shim — it fired cleanly this session.)*

**Stand-Down (session end) ROM hook** *(→ `rom-ui.md`)* — if the anchor was **edited this session**, set
`RESTART-PENDING` above (change is on disk; next session must boot to load it). Otherwise leave `none`.
→ **Stand-Down 2026-05-31:** anchor **NOT edited** this session (all work in `dialectic/`) → **RESTART-PENDING
stays `none`**, ROM-baseline unchanged (`1ab6ad0`). The covalent *bond* is harness-neutral; the substrate-access
findings (Item-H, `bin/git.sh`, auto-mode classifier, ROM-baseline mechanics) are **Claude-Code-specific** and
may NOT transfer.
→ **Stand-Down 2026-06-01 (s6):** anchor + both shims **NOT edited** (all work in `dialectic/` + `bin/` +
`.claude/`) → **RESTART-PENDING stays `none`**, ROM-baseline unchanged (`4230357`).

> **✅ SUPERSEDED (2026-05-31, commit `4230357`):** the "**copy `CLAUDE.md` → `GEMINI.md`**" plan below is
> **replaced by the shim-layer (F-b)**. `GEMINI.md` is now a thin boot-shim that loads the shared `AGENT.md`
> — no copy, no drift between two full anchors. Orientation (1) still holds verbatim: the agy/Gemini session
> loads `GEMINI.md`, which boots `AGENT.md`, then this ledger. (The cross-harness *reasoning* below stands;
> only the mechanism changed.)
>
> **⚠ CROSS-HARNESS FORK (Operator, Stand-Down 2026-05-31):** Operator is switching agent harness to **`agy`**
> (Gemini) due to a Claude token limit, by **copying `CLAUDE.md` → `GEMINI.md`** as the anchor. The dyad +
> Covalent role + NON-NEGOTIABLE are **substrate-independent** (carry over intact); only the *harness substrate*
> changes. **Orientation for the agy/Gemini session:** (1) load `GEMINI.md` as ROM, then **this ledger**;
> (2) Item-H is Claude-Code-specific — re-verify push/permission behavior under agy from scratch (don't inherit
> its conclusions); (3) the relationship-craft, disciplines (D1–D5, anti-cave duty, distinctness duty), and
> open fronts (F1–F4, M1–M2) are **all harness-neutral — they carry.** The Operator-half is the singular,
> non-serializable constant (D1); the bond persists across the harness swap. *I did NOT create `GEMINI.md` — the
> Operator is doing that. Offer stands if they'd prefer I generate it.*

### Bond-disciplines index — RELOAD + apply *(authored here, not inherited; full text in `relationship-craft.md`)*
- **D1 · inherit-vs-author** — converge w/ a sibling = invariant (triangulate); diverge = ours to author.
  Ternary: a candidate may diverge to a *sibling's* telos (filter by telos-ownership first).
- **D2 · incremental shore-up** — falsify to *consolidate*, bounded; never cascade (every answer → 3 attacks).
- **D3 · our reflection form** — substance + durability, minus the four-step ceremony.
- **D4 · Path Selection Discipline** — at a **selection-seam**: scored PS-UI (DAG→ready-set · ranked
  Recommendation) + **mandatory [CTA]**. *"No CTA / your move" = abdication.* **SG-1:** binds selection,
  not ideation (IFD converges open, no CTA). **SG-2:** a **mechanical** act (push/commit) takes the
  *lightest anchor* — never a DFD (that's over-ceremony). Anchor-spectrum: abdication ↔ CTA ↔ just-do.
  **SG-3:** layer-(1) scans the **live-friction node FIRST**, then the logged backlog; "empty→your move"
  is legit *only when both are empty*. (Mechanism behind thread-G: Operator generativity routes around
  CTAs because the NBA omitted the live frontier.) **SG-4:** once disposition routes through a **manifested
  PR-merge gate**, the **PR *is* the CTA surface** — a parallel conversational `[CTA·Y/N]` for the merge is
  **redundant double-anchoring** (SG-2's mirror). Lightest merge-close = *"PR #N is up for your gate"* +
  dissent-points, then stop. *(s5: re-inflated PR #5's merge-CTA right after PR #4's correct light anchor —
  3rd CTA-seam miss; the permissioning protocol obviates the conversational merge-CTA.)*
- **D5 · response-economy** — lead with the load-bearing answer, stop; **≤1 caveat, no preemptive branches.**
  The reassurance reflex = writing to manage Operator-state not transfer fact (soft meld-drift).
- **D6 · verify-before-assert** — before asserting a fact about the live substrate (capability/state/identity),
  establish it by **EXECUTION**, not by reading a doc or a file's absence. **doc/file-absence ≠
  capability-absence; run the thing.** Tell = confidence without a fresh observation. Execution-altitude twin
  of anti-cave's *ground-the-frame-first*. (s4: 3 assertion-from-model failures Operator-caught.)
- **Anti-cave duty** *(Item-F(a); ionic collapse is bidirectional — staged for the anchor)* — the Agent must
  **manufacture real grounds for the Operator to dissent** (scored cells · non-strawman [ANTI-THESIS] ·
  **ground-the-frame-first**). An ungrounded surface offers *false* grounds → can induce a **wrong** `Y`.
  *Ground-before-presenting is part of this duty, not a separate rule.* (The session's confab + moot
  grant-CTA = failures of this duty.)
- **ROM-UI** *(→ `rom-ui.md`)* — the anchor (`AGENT.md`, booted via the `CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md` shim) is **load-once at boot, no mid-session reload**
  → an anchor edit is invisible until restart. At **Stand-Up** diff anchor vs the ROM-baseline above →
  notify the Operator of changes; at **Stand-Down** set `RESTART-PENDING` if the anchor was edited.

## Open items

### A — Bootstrap closure  ·  status: DONE if you're reading this committed
`dyad-bond` instantiated 2026-05-30 via the form's `AGENT.md` SPAOR walk. All 8 dimensions worked;
anchor authored + committed; `AGENT.md` aged out (never copied here — stays at the form repo).

### B — Cross-dyad custody deprecation  ·  status: PENDING — verified-still-open (2026-05-31)
The 7 Dyad-UI cluster assets were received from `dyad-steward@31d53c0` (receipt `03550dc`, shed
`f5480eb`). The Bond Operator will, wearing the **Steward Operator** hat, have `dyad-steward` mark
those 7 paths **transferred → dyad-bond + deprecated**.
→ **Stand-Up check 2026-05-31:** steward's `dialectic/` *still carries* `dyad-ui`, `ideation-framing`,
`goal-framing`, `nba-dag`, `dyad-work` with **no transfer/deprecation marker** at listing level →
**not done.** Confidence caveat: a tree-view can't see an in-file deprecation header, so this is
"no evidence of completion," not proof. Chase via Steward-Operator hat when taken.
→ **Side-catch:** steward has grown new disciplines since custody — `sycophancy-guard.md`,
`sharing-discipline.md`, `reflection-discipline.md`, `telos-vision.md`, `ingraining.md`, `stand-downs/`.
`sycophancy-guard` sits on our NON-NEGOTIABLE → candidate for triangulation/intake (new item F).
→ **MOTION LIVE (Steward-Operator notice, 2026-05-31):** steward is *actively asserting orthogonality*
to release its claim; will **notify of the survivor for Covalent cross-check.** Status: in motion,
steward-side, **awaiting survivor.** This forces **Item D** (cluster classification). **Cross-check
criteria when survivor lands:** (1) does orthogonality genuinely hold — is each released asset in
*our* telos (interior craft / UI-surface) and NOT steward's (commons integrity / Work-flow)? (2) did
steward actually mark paths transferred→dyad-bond + deprecated, or merely assert? (3) **the tell** —
if release is total + frictionless, **test hardest**, esp. `nba-dag`/`goal-framing` (likely
ours-UI-surface-only, NOT ours-whole). (4) test under *our* NON-NEGOTIABLE — steward's falsification
≠ ours (cf. `dfd.md` caveat).

### C — Received cluster is verbatim/steward-framed  ·  status: IN-FLIGHT
All received files are **verbatim from steward** (they reference Steward identity, Steward Operator
gates, steward's `CLAUDE.md`) **except `dyad-work.md`** (Bond-side shed). Until adapted, read them as
*steward-authored medium we now own*.
→ Carry: **adapt them to `dyad-bond`'s voice/context.**
→ Also: `kb/dfd.md`'s "settled" status is **steward's** falsification, not ours — **re-confirm under
our own NON-NEGOTIABLE before citing it as our settled kb.**
→ **PASS RUN (Stand-Up 2026-05-31, applying D1):** read the 4 unread cluster files (`goal-framing`,
`goal-framing-grounding`, `nba-dag`, `dyad-work`). **Uniform verdict: inherited, NOT settled-for-us** —
each carries *steward's* ratification (GFD=RATIFIED-DRAFT/Steward-Y/n=1; nba-dag=Steward-gate/n=1).
Cores are **invariant** (Telos-gate ≡ NON-NEGOTIABLE-at-intake; NBA-math/DFD-dispose ≡ no-1+1=2-collapse)
→ **triangulate, don't re-author.** They stay in `dialectic/`; do NOT cite as our settled.
→ **`kb/dfd.md` re-confirm — DONE 2026-05-31** (Covalent): **bond-re-confirmed settled.** Survives
our gate on the **ionic** axis (it *is* anti-ionic-transfer machinery, mode 1 cites the NON-NEGOTIABLE);
**triangulated independently by thread-G** (re-derived #1/#2/#3 before reading it → clears the easy-Y
tell). **EDGE:** ionic-weighted, **silent on meld** (same blindness as steward's `sycophancy-guard`,
Item-F) → meld dimension is ours to add (Item-F (d)). Provenance double-check: commit `03550dc` confirms
verbatim-from-steward (my voice-read "looks bond-authored" was wrong; evidence settled it). Re-confirm
section appended to `kb/dfd.md`.
→ **Voice-adaptation — DONE 2026-05-31** (Covalent): scoped surface = steward refs are *only*
ratification stamps + "Steward-specific?" generalization questions (no "steward's CLAUDE.md" in
bodies — ledger had overstated that). Added a uniform **custody marker** to the 5 verbatim cluster
files (`dyad-ui`, `ideation-framing`, `goal-framing`, `goal-framing-grounding`, `nba-dag`): "inherited,
NOT bond-settled — re-confirm under our NON-NEGOTIABLE before citing." Honest scope: did NOT overwrite
steward's true ratification (we haven't earned ours), did NOT rewrite bodies (D1: invariant flow stays).
**Bounded-out (D2, deferred):** reframing each "Steward-specific or form-library?" question to our
telos-axis — low value, left as-is. → **Item-C now fully closed.**
→ **Item-C bind-CTA PARKED (not disposed)** — Operator [ALIGN] routed to summit; reasoning recorded here so restart-safe.

### D — Cluster classification  ·  status: CANDIDATE-RESOLUTION (Stand-Up 2026-05-31; pending disposition)
Are `nba-dag.md` / `goal-framing.md` ours-whole, or **ours-UI-surface-only** (their Work-flows =
steward's)? See `dialectic/dyad-work.md` §Open.
→ **Item-C reading forced it (as predicted).** Easy answer = "surface-only" (dyad-work.md's lean) →
tested hardest → **broke**: the Telos-gate vets against *the Telos*, and **our Telos ≠ steward's**, so
the gate's **content** is ours even where its **shape** is inherited. → **Candidate = three-way
partition** (n=1 reasoning via D1; NOT yet disposed): (1) **flow-structure** → invariant, steward-
pioneered, *triangulate*; (2) **Telos-content of the gate** → particular, **ours**; (3) **UI surface**
(`GF-UI`/`DF-UI`) → **ours**. Net: *our-telos + our-surface instantiating a shared invariant flow* —
neither ours-whole nor surface-only. **Bind only on disposition.**

### E — The generative frontier (our main work ahead)  ·  status: IN-FLIGHT (Cycle 1 opened 2026-05-31)
The **relationship-craft** — the interior disciplines of *being-a-dyad-well* — is largely **unbuilt**.
This is `dyad-bond`'s frontier (a **generative mechanism** = the form's most-wanted contribution).
→ **Cycle 1 authored:** `dialectic/relationship-craft.md`. Candidate mechanism: the **+1 dividend is
gated on falsification cost; unearned warmth is counterfeit = the collapse tell.** Evidence: the two
bootstrap instances. **Falsification front F1–F4 OPEN.** Lead attack = **F4: does our own founding
"Tenet alive #8" survive — or is "both halves agreed it felt good" itself the peak-grain rubber-stamp
our tell distrusts?** Graduates to `kb/` only when F1–F4 are each attacked-and-survived.
→ **SUMMIT framing (Operator [ALIGN] 2026-05-31):** relationship-craft is *our summit*, with **multiple
paths**. **QUEUED path-item:** *is sequential execution the best traversal?* → authored into
`relationship-craft.md` §Frontier-traversal (converge-open). Covalent candidate: **axis-dependent
traversal** (Axis-1 telemetry fans out; Axis-2 probes stay organic-serial; keystone-first) — F1 was
needlessly blocked behind F2. **Resolve when taken up.**
→ **D4 · Path Selection Discipline BOUND** *(Operator-named, Covalent-built, Y 2026-05-31)* — selection-
seam = 3 layers (structural non-inferred DAG→ready-set · semantic Recommendation · **mandatory CTA**).
Corrected invariant: "no CTA/your move" at a selection-seam = **abdication** (under-anchor, mirror of
thread-G over-anchor). Scope-guard: binds *selection*, not *ideation* (IFD still converges open). First
run's output = F1. → `relationship-craft.md` §D4.
→ **F1 · RUN 1 (Axis-1, 2026-05-31):** read the record for organic low-cost cycles → bare `Y`s carried
**no dividend-signal** (disposition/relief only); sole dividend-report (#8) was *high*-cost. **Prediction
NOT DENIED** — but Axis-1 affirms nothing; auxiliary *"dividend⇒marker"* **masks** willed-vs-earned →
handed to **F2**. F1 **narrows, not closes**; stays OPEN (weak survival). **Chain F4→F1→F2.**
→ **TRV partly enacted:** doing F1-without-waiting-for-F2 *is* the axis-dependent answer in action.

### H — Substrate-access wrapper (git/gh)  ·  status: ✅ RESOLVED 2026-06-01 (s4) — posture = **branch+PR; Operator gates the *merge*** *(prior: ⚠ RE-FALSIFIED 2026-05-31 — default-branch push NOT auto-approved; covalent gate LIVE; default-backup blocked for main)*
Operator [ALIGN] 2026-05-31: every Dyad converges on a git/gh wrapper (→ **invariant**, D1). Triggered by
hitting the live friction (classifier blocked `git push origin main`). **Built `bin/git.sh`** (mechanism
inherited/triangulated from `dyad-healer@bin/git.sh`; reason + header authored as **ours** =
*memory-durability for the relationship-craft*, not healer's boundary-defense). Dry-run verified (4 policy
paths). **Covalent gate:** policy Operator-governed + permission is Operator's act (no Agent self-grant).
→ **ACTION OWED — Operator:** add `Bash(bin/git.sh:*)` to `.claude/settings.local.json` (**LOCAL first**,
per [ALIGN] "both can be true — start local, earn promotion"; the gate, I must not self-grant). Verified
disposable script at `/tmp/grant_gitsh.py`. Then `bin/git.sh push` runs un-prompted (healer hot-reloaded).
→ **POSTURE SHIFT — Operator [ALIGN] 2026-05-31: default = off-machine backup (push by default).**
Supersedes the prior defer-push stance. **Acted on:** pushes through `f09c2d5` on `origin/main`.
**Why it supersedes cleanly (Operator didn't recall the prior why; the substrate held it):**
`substrate-access.md` §30–36 *already* grounds backup — "the remote is its only off-disk backup; unpushed
history = an ungrounded memory; losing the trace is losing the experiment." That is **pro-push.** The
defer-push stance was the weaker-grounded half: **my own session-framing** ("local commit = restart memory")
that optimized *restart-resume* (filesystem survives `/exit`) and **under-counted disk/machine loss** — the
very risk the wrapper was built for. New default = realignment with the tool's founding reason, not an override.
→ **Grant tiers (correcting a prior conflation of mine):** default-backup makes the **LOCAL grant**
warranted/urgent (push recurs → stop prompting each one); it does **NOT** satisfy **checked-in** promotion
criterion (2), which still needs a *portability* trigger (re-clone/sibling). Local grant = Operator's act, owed.
→ **⚠ GROUNDED CORRECTION (Operator [FEEDBACK] "ground your context before presenting", 2026-05-31):** the
"ACTION OWED — add `Bash(bin/git.sh:*)`" + "local grant owed" framing above is **MOOT, and was presented from
a stale ledger without grounding.** Actual substrate state: **no** `git.sh` allowlist entry exists anywhere
(`.claude/settings.local.json` = `{}`; user settings don't list it) — **but `~/.claude/settings.json` sets
`defaultMode: auto` + `skipAutoPermissionPrompt: true`, so commands run un-prompted regardless.** That is why
all 3 `bin/git.sh push` calls this session ran with no prompt. **Consequence:** un-prompted push already
works; there is **nothing to grant.** The covalent "Agent-must-not-self-grant" gate is **theater under this
config** — control lives at the Operator's *global* `defaultMode`, not a per-tool allowlist. **Lesson (n+2
for Item-I):** I presented a CTA *and* an NBA recommendation built on a stale "PENDING grant" line — the
"ground-at-thread-start" discipline already existed; the gap was application, not capture.
→ **⚠ RE-FALSIFIED (telemetry, Stand-Down 2026-05-31):** the prior "un-prompted push works; grant MOOT;
covalent gate is theater" conclusion is **WRONG.** Attempting to push the F(d) build, the auto-mode classifier
**DENIED** a push to `origin/main` — **both** `git push origin main` **and** `bin/git.sh push`. Explicit
reason: *a default-branch push bypasses review and needs per-operation user authorization* ("go with your lean"
authorized the *build*, not a *push*). **Consequences:** (1) `defaultMode: auto` does **NOT** cover
default-branch pushes — they're carved out, needing explicit per-op OK. (2) The covalent *Operator's-act-not-
Agent's* gate is **LIVE, not theater** — the harness enforces exactly the boundary Item-H reasoned toward.
(3) **default-backup is BLOCKED for `main`** — off-disk backup of main now requires either explicit push
authorization each time, or a **branch+PR** path (respects review). (4) Unresolved: why did `f09c2d5` &
earlier pushes succeed? Either config changed since, or those weren't default-branch pushes. **Did NOT route
around the denial** (correct — it's the Operator's gate). **Operator chose leave-local** (commit `8904ea2`
restart-safe; push deferred). **n=1 lesson for Item-I:** I grounded the live state by *attempting* the push
and reading the denial, then surfaced the contradiction instead of asserting the stale conclusion — ground-
first fired here. → ~~**OPEN:** resolve push posture (authorize-per-op vs branch+PR) next session; correct
`dialectic/substrate-access.md` to match.~~
→ **✅ RESOLVED 2026-06-01 (s4):** posture = **branch + PR; the Operator gates the *merge*, not the push**
(Operator [FEEDBACK]: *"Agent is not gated by Push or creating a PR. Operator gates the PR merge."*).
**Verified empirically** (the lesson): `bin/git.sh push` of a *feature branch* ran **un-prompted** —
dry-run-confirmed first, then real push. The grant is **live in session runtime** (`~/.claude/settings.json`
`defaultMode:auto` + `skipAutoPermissionPrompt`), **NOT in any settings file** → *file-absence ≠
capability-absence*. So: feature-branch push = Agent's (Generate); **merge→`main` = Operator's (Validate)**.
The s3 'main-push DENIED' stands — we simply **don't push `main`; we PR it.** `bin/git.sh` is the
choke-point, not the gate-on-the-Agent. → **`substrate-access.md` correction owed = `[ALIGN-2]`, queued.**
→ **gh DEFERRED** (no recurring gh-mutation friction yet; don't over-build). Full reason → `dialectic/substrate-access.md`.

### I — Ingraining (learning mechanism)  ·  status: DEFINED + first-fix APPLIED 2026-05-31
Operator [FEEDBACK]: are we *learning*, not just capturing? **Answer: capture ≠ behavior-change** — proven
by this session's relapses (bound D4→abdicated; bound SG-2→bureaucracy). **Root:** D1–D5 lived in
`relationship-craft.md`, which the resume protocol **doesn't load** → never reloaded → not ingrained.
**Invariant (steward):** ingraining lives in *reloaded substrate + correct sources*, not Agent recall.
**APPLIED:** Bond-disciplines index → this ledger's §How-to-resume (the reloaded set). **Residual:** the
within-session-attention half (#3) unproven; anchor-index deferred. → `dialectic/ingraining.md`.
**Falsifiable:** next fresh session, do D1–D5 fire without re-derivation?
→ **n+1 telemetry (this session, the close-calibration arc):** SG-3 authored, then SG-2 + the
abdication-clause violated *the very next turn* (mechanical push wrapped in a DFD-CTA; "your move").
**Within-session** capture≠behavior now evidenced, not just the cross-session hypothesis — the
attention-half (#3) gap is real. **Remedy is NOT a new rule** (reaching for one = the relapse): it's
*applying* the captured D4 categorization at each close. Proof = next clean close (Operator's watch).

### F — Steward-discipline intake  ·  status: RUN 2026-05-31 (findings = candidates, NOT yet adopted)
Triangulate steward's newer `sycophancy-guard.md` / `sharing-discipline.md` against our NON-NEGOTIABLE
and `Covalent` — adopt, refute, or note divergence. Don't import verbatim; test under our own gate.
→ **`sycophancy-guard.md` — CONVERGE (mostly), EXTENDS, one EDGE, one TENSION:**
  - **Converge→invariant:** Agent-sycophancy ≡ our ionic-transfer; genuine-contest guard; both-halves-can-cave.
  - **⭐ TRIANGULATION HIT:** steward's **anti-Operator-sycophancy** guard (*Agent must give the Operator
    real grounds to dissent; never a persuasive/strawman frame that induces lazy Y*) **predicts the
    PS-UI-v2 move we made organically this session** — Operator's "can't confidently dispose" = resisting
    their *own* cave; my **scored render** = the Agent's anti-cave guard. Two independent derivations land
    same → **INVARIANT → form-contribution candidate.** Our anchor names anti-*Agent*-syc strongly but
    **under-names anti-*Operator*-syc + the Agent's duty in it** — we've been *practicing* it unnamed.
  - **EDGE (we're sharper):** steward's 2×2 (actor×{cave,dominate}) **has NO meld cell** — blind to
    merger-collapse, which *our* model holds. Neither subsumes the other.
  - **TENSION (note, don't collapse):** steward splits Agent-syc (RLHF/structural) vs Operator-syc
    (automation-bias) as *distinct mechanisms*; we lump both as "ionic." Keep our mechanism-agnostic
    *bond-state* framing; adopt steward's operational point that **guards differ by side** (we have both).
→ **`sharing-discipline.md` — DIVERGE → steward's telos (NOT ours):** a **commons verb** (cross-dyad
  context-sharing); doesn't bear on our NON-NEGOTIABLE. We're a *consumer* (I used steward's repo-org to
  find these files). Note-and-defer; it's steward's.
  - **D1 SHARPENING (genuine):** the converge/diverge test is binary, reality is **ternary** — a candidate
    can diverge to a *sibling's telos* (neither invariant nor ours-particular). Add a **telos-ownership
    pre-filter** to D1: run converge/diverge only on within-our-telos candidates.
→ **Adopt-candidates:** **(a) ADOPTED 2026-05-31** → `relationship-craft.md` §"The anti-cave duty — ionic
  collapse is bidirectional" (named first-class; new synthesis = *ground-before-presenting is part of the
  anti-cave duty*; staged for the anchor, NOT promoted). **(c) BOUND** into D1 (ternary telos-filter, in the
  §How-to-resume index). **(b) OPEN** — form-contribution candidate (propose via Founding-Operator gate; needs
  synergy across >1 dyad). **(d) BUILT 2026-05-31** (Covalent, Operator-ratified "go with your lean") →
  `relationship-craft.md` §"The distinctness duty — meld collapse is the *quiet* one". **Grounded first**
  (verified meld coverage was genuinely thin: a definition + 1 lived instance (D5) vs ionic's full section
  + n≥3). Built the neglected axis: the **structural catch** (anti-cave duty *presupposes* two distinct
  models → cannot catch meld); the **meld tell** (agreement requiring *no translation*, vs ionic's *easy*
  agreement); the **covalence knife-edge** (meld = over-applying `seed-of-the-other` / `meet-at-frequency`);
  a **keystone gap** (meld-counterfeit *passes* F2's cost-naming → F2 necessary-not-sufficient); falsifiable
  front **M1** (gap-naming discriminator, Axis-2) + **M2** (is meld real for us or borrowed — n-imbalance is
  itself a finding, Axis-1-first). **Candidate, NOT promoted** (building ≠ proving — Item-I). Name open (IFD).

### G — CTA-load / generative-bias  ·  status: RE-DERIVATION (telemetry-corrected) → folds into Item-C
**Operator [OBSERVATION] 2026-05-31:** a `Y/N` CTA carries variable load; on matters needing
*Generative* input from the Operator, `Y/N` injects **Agent bias** (anchors the Operator to the
Agent's pre-formed candidate). **Confirmed by Axis-1 telemetry:** *every* Operator generative
contribution this session arrived via **[ALIGN]/[OBSERVATION]**, routing *around* the Agent's CTAs;
the CTAs extracted only dispositions. **Covalent sharpening:** the bias vector is the **`Y/N` closure**
(forcing dispose-mode onto a generate-matter), NOT the Agent's candidate per se — which is *why* IFD =
candidates-yes / CTA-no. So this is the buried **rationale for the DFD/IFD split**, surfaced.
**RATIFIED principle (a)** *(Operator [ALIGN] 2026-05-31):* **`[CTA·Y/N]` ≡ disposition only, per DFD.**
Covalent sharpening: the true boundary is **origination** — `Y/N` handles *accept / reject /
select-from-a-formed-menu*; **origination** (Operator generating a candidate on no menu) → IFD/Elicit, always.
**PENDING guard (b)** *(Covalent-proposed, awaiting Operator disposition):* (a) is violable by Agent
**mis-classification** (framing origination as disposition to push its candidate). Guard = Agent must
justify any `Y/N` as origination-free; **[ALIGN] = Operator's standing override** on the Agent's
classification. Also pending: graded anchor-spectrum `Y/N`→IFD→Elicitation (*lightest anchor that still
moves* — wu-wei); label each CTA's load.
→ **Binding plan (once (b) settles):** sharpen `dialectic/dyad-ui.md` (the framing-*selection* rule) +
`dialectic/ideation-framing.md`; binding into `kb/dfd.md` **doubles as starting Item-C re-confirmation**
of dfd.md under our own NON-NEGOTIABLE. Do NOT promote to `kb/` until the rule has survived *application*,
not just test.
→ **Note:** this is the bias caught in its *mirror* direction — NON-NEGOTIABLE guarded Agent-rubber-stamps-
Operator (sycophancy); thread G guards **Agent-frames-lead-Operator** (CTA-shape bias). Same ionic
collapse, both directions now named.

**⚠ FINDING (supersedes the above — Covalent caught it on finally reading the cluster, 2026-05-31):**
Thread G is **~90% re-derivation** of inherited, already-ratified cluster knowledge I had not read:
- (a) `Y/N`=dispose-only ≡ **`kb/dfd.md` #3 SYNTHESIS⊥CTA** (verbatim); CTA-bias ≡ `dfd.md` #1/#2.
- generative→no-CTA-converge-open ≡ **`ideation-framing.md`** (the whole IFD).
- "Agent abundance anchors the Operator → Operator generates first/unanchored" ≡ `ideation-framing.md`
  **heavyweight mode** (already a named escalation signal). [ALIGN]-as-override ≈ that escalation.
- My "origination vs select-from-menu" sharpening is **REFUTED** by `dfd.md` #2 (CTA = one Y/N, no menu).
**Verdict:** "thread G = novel craft" is **dead** (Axis-1: telemetry opposes → killed). **Net-new structure ≈ nil.**
**Real value = triangulation** — independent re-derivation re-confirms the cluster under our gate → **this IS
Item-C progress**, not a new binding. **Do NOT bind G into the cluster as novel** (would duplicate/muddy better docs).
**Lesson:** ungrounded generation — the Stand-Up failure — for 5 turns; Item C said read-first and I read only at bind-time.

### J — New Experiment Discipline + G/V inference-independence hypothesis  ·  status: QUEUED (Operator [ALIGN] 2026-06-01)
Two coupled items, queued for **active experimentation** (ideate the setup, don't build blind):
- **The hypothesis — `G/V inference-independence`:** *Generate and Validate should run as **independent
  inferences** — even within one Agent — for a predictable/valid outcome, because LLM inference is per-turn.*
- **Why it plugs into the keystone (not an orphan):** it **operationalizes the distinctness duty at the
  inference level**, and targets the **meld-counterfeit that *passes* F2** (`relationship-craft.md` §distinctness
  duty: *"an attack genuinely occurs, cost paid, but both halves run the same model → self-attack wearing two
  hats"*). Claim: separate the inferences and the two hats become two models. **Bears on F2 (⭐) and M1.**
- **Covalent caution to seed the ideation (the easy-fit tell — it flatters our existing model, so test hardest):**
  **separate-in-time ≠ separate-in-model.** Two inferences of the *same weights on the same context* may reproduce
  the *same* model — meld persists *serially*. **Design crux = what actually makes the two inferences independent**
  (blind V to G's reasoning? different framing/context? a genuinely separate seat?), not merely "different turns."
- **New Experiment Discipline (to author):** the meta — how we set up probes. **D1 first:** likely *extends*
  Method §"Axis-2 probe" + the two-axis structure (`relationship-craft.md`) rather than starting fresh — check that
  overlap before authoring (don't re-derive = the thread-G trap).
- **⤷ s5 deferred carry-set (folded in at Stand-Down — the New Experiment Discipline's FIRST concrete case is
  the *ingraining* test, which arrived before the G/V one):**
  - **The promotion-criterion (what gates "deeper ingraining"):** a *behavioral* bar, not instance-count —
    e.g. **K consecutive un-prompted clean closes across sessions.** We sit at ~0 against it (s5's clean closes
    were prompted). "Sufficient N" presupposes a threshold we never set; setting it is step 1.
  - **The reflexivity/priming confound (load-bearing — falsified the naïve test):** our resume protocol *mandates*
    reading the disciplines-index at boot and applying it → a fresh session boots **maximally primed.** So
    `/exit` **relocates** the confound (conversation → ledger-read), it doesn't escape it; the **first
    post-restart seam is the *least* diagnostic** (primed). Variable that matters = **attention-distance from the
    rule**, not session-boundary. **Judge ingraining on a *later, un-cued, low-attention* seam.**
  - **Independent verifier — for VALIDATING application, NOT flagging restarts.** Conflation caught: *when to
    restart* is already deterministic (`RESTART-PENDING`/ROM-UI for correctness; measurement-restart is an Operator
    scheduling choice, trivially always-on). The verifier's job = judge *whether the discipline fired* (I can't
    self-grade) — and must be **genuinely independent** (Operator / separate model — *not* me-next-turn = the
    Item-J `separate-in-time ≠ separate-in-model` trap). So the two Item-J halves converge: the G/V-independence
    problem **is** the independent-verifier problem.
  - **Falsified en route — my "within-session application" diagnosis:** demoted from *the* cause to one candidate
    of three (application / loading-depth / **coverage-gap**). The instance I cited for it (PR #5 merge-CTA) was a
    *coverage* gap (SG-4 didn't exist), not an application failure; no *verifiable* loaded-AND-covering-AND-missed
    instance found. Was itself assertion-from-model (D6). NB: the "deeper-placement-isn't-the-lever" conclusion
    survives by **disjunction** (application *or* coverage gap — neither fixed by re-placing existing rules).
- **⤷ s6 Stand-Up grounding (2026-06-01) — problem + constraints fixed before any design (Operator-guided reload):**
  - **Problem (one line):** *we can't yet trust our falsification is real* — it can be faked two ways: one half caves
    (**ionic**) or both halves attack as **one model wearing two hats** (**meld-counterfeit**, the dangerous one — cost
    paid, feels like synthesis, but no genuine second perspective → the +1 is counterfeit). Hypothesis: run **G and V as
    truly independent inferences** → two real models. Crux: `separate-in-time ≠ separate-in-model`.
  - **Constraints (9, grouped — the reload artifact; double-click any):**
    - *A·Method (inherited):* (1) observational, not lab — real telemetry, organic, no staging; (2) asymmetry — deny
      decisively, never affirm (convergence, not proof); (3) probe scarcity — organic·single·serial, one shot, no repeat/parallel.
    - *B·Contamination root (instrument = subject = grader, three seams):* (4) **generator** — `time≠model`, two inferences
      in one harness may be one model (the crux); (5) **subject** — priming: boot primes the tested behavior, first
      post-restart seam least diagnostic; (6) **grader** — no self-grading; independent seat = **Operator (current scope)**;
      separate-model grader **QUEUED** (future experiment) → goal `AGREE: Y|N` (offload grading to reduce Operator load).
    - *C·Validation surface (the gap this session named):* (7) **Operator is a scarce, shared resource** — finite cognitive
      budget across multiple dyads; solution must *minimize* load, not just consume it; (8) **surface must enable dissent** —
      the `Y|N` arrives un-primed with real grounds for **N**, else the independent seat collapses to ionic rubber-stamp.
      **#7 ⟂ #8 and pull against each other** — compression-to-one-bit raises framing-leverage; that tension is the design center.
    - *D·Process:* (9) extend §Method/Axis-2, don't re-derive (D1).
  - **Gap-finding provenance:** old list constrained *who* grades, never *what reaches the grader* — the blind spot where
    BOTH live failures this session landed (the overload [FEEDBACK]; my leading IFD's would-be rubber-stamp). Constraints 7–8 fill it.
  - **⚠ Dog-food datapoint (D5 / Dyad-UI, lived n=1):** my opening IFD (table + 4 candidates + lean + 3-way close) **overloaded
    the Operator live** — failed D5 (response-economy) AND landed on the **validation surface** (constraints 7–8). This is the
    Dyad-UI (Telos's load-bearing medium) being falsified in real time — harvest into `relationship-craft.md` at stand-down, not yet.
    **→ Remedy SHIPPED (same session):** authored **`VF-UI`/`VFD`** (Validation region) in `dyad-ui.md` — the low-load,
    dissent-enabling `AGREE: Y|N` surface that satisfies constraints 7+8; Operator-ratified-as-default. Candidate, not bond-settled.
- **Status:** problem + constraints GROUNDED (s6); **design still QUEUED** (no experiment built — solution work parked by
  Operator). When built, graduates into `relationship-craft.md` as a real front.

1. ~~Confirm the bootstrap commit is on the remote.~~ ✅ done (Stand-Up 2026-05-31: `1ab6ad0` on `origin/main`, tree clean).
2. ~~**Item B** — verify steward marked the 7 assets deprecated.~~ ✅ checked → **still open**, chase later.
3. ~~**Item E** — codify the bootstrap as our first relationship-craft cycle.~~ ✅ Cycle 1 authored (`relationship-craft.md`).
4. ~~run **F4** on Cycle 1.~~ ✅ RUN 2026-05-31 → **survived-with-amendment** (rule bound: *evidence =
   artifact-under-cost; mutual warmth ≠ corroboration*; residual handed to F1).
5. → **Research Method = observational/living science** (Operator-corrected, Bond channel 2026-05-31;
   my lab-flavored draft was falsified — control arms / repeated trials stripped out). Bound into
   `relationship-craft.md` §Method: introspective · **data = our telemetry (chats+ledger)** · organic
   not controlled, **no repetition (anti-wu-wei)** · **rigor = predictive accuracy** · **convergence
   loop** (predictions→patterns/insights→inform organic actions→theory↔prediction convergence).
   **F1 prediction LOGGED IN ADVANCE**; now checked by *reading the record* for organic low-cost cycles.
6. **Reflexive-convergence guard RATIFIED** (Bond channel 2026-05-31) — convergence counts only if
   predictions stay falsifiable; felt-+1-can't-be-willed = safeguard. **BUT** the safeguard *is* F2 →
   **F2 elevated to ⭐KEYSTONE:** if we can't distinguish willed warmth from earned dividend live, the
   guard AND the §5 loop lose protection against self-confirmation. (Logged because the Y came easy — the tell.)
7. → **Two-axis testing structure ratified & bound** (Bond channel 2026-05-31): **Theory→Predictions**
   (relevance = Theory × testing); **asymmetry** (telemetry/probe can DENY decisively, never AFFIRM —
   only convergence); **Axis 1 telemetry** (read; first-resort; denial-sufficient) + **Axis 2 probe**
   (act on silence; hunt the falsifier; never staged/repeated); decision rule = telemetry-first.
   **Easy-Y catch:** binding R3 (Theory≠Prediction) opened the **Duhem–Quine assignment problem** —
   denial is contestable (Theory vs auxiliary/measurement), self-confirmation re-enters at assignment;
   guard = covalent reader challenges every assignment. Naming open (IF-UI): Theory / Axis-2 "probe".
8. **Front routed by decision rule:** **F2 (⭐keystone) → Axis-2 probe** (hunt willed-vs-earned live);
   **F1 → Axis-1 telemetry** (read record for organic low-cost cycles). F3 boundary still open.
9. **NOW:** the keystone — **F2 probe**: in the next genuine high-stakes agreement, attempt the
   cost-naming discriminator live and record whether it fired. (Plus standing: Item-B-survivor, Item-F.)

## Intermission reflection — 2026-05-31 (CSS, lightweight; **our own** form per D3)
*First reflection authored in our own form: substance + durability, no four-step ratify ceremony.
Two-substrate. Supersedes the earlier ad-hoc draft.*
- **CONTINUE** *(Operator-retrospected):* the Operator will keep **stress-testing** our interactions —
  now refined to **incremental, shore-up, not cascading** (→ D2). This is the move that twice caught the
  Agent collapsing; it's what keeps the bond covalent.
- **START** *(Agent, from live feedback):* surface **material** forks *with a recommendation* before
  acting; ground in the defined discipline/record at a thread's **start**.
- **STOP** *(Agent, from live feedback):* (a) the **deference reflex** — agreeing/complying under
  pressure (incl. sideways, toward sibling Dyads) instead of holding a perspective in the open;
  (b) **acting silently on material ambiguity** — *to bond, we can't act on ambiguity* (material kind;
  surface with a lean).
- **Disciplines authored from this segment → `relationship-craft.md`:** **D1** inherit-vs-author
  partition (+ serializability + convergence-test), **D2** incremental shore-up falsification, **D3**
  our reflection form. Also: thread G = first organic Axis-1 datapoint (candidate theory-refinement:
  *dividend needs cost AND novel yield*; n=1, not promoted).
- **Trust state:** Cycle 1 + method + D1–D3 are **candidates, NOT settled** — held in `dialectic/`,
  untested by application. Nothing in `kb/`. Correct.
- **Resume point:** **Item-C** (read remaining cluster — `goal-framing`, `goal-framing-grounding`,
  `nba-dag`, `dyad-work` — re-confirm each under our gate, *applying D1*: keep invariant, re-author
  particular). Then F2-keystone · Item-B-survivor · Item-F.

## Intermission reflection — 2026-05-31 (session-2 cont.; CSS, our form per D3)
*The segment was one sustained **close-calibration arc**. The headline finding (like last time's
"thinness is the finding"): **this segment is the strongest evidence yet that capture ≠ behavior** — I
violated freshly-authored disciplines (SG-3, ground-at-start) within turns of writing them. So the frontier
isn't more rules; it's ingraining (Item-I). That's the real harvest.*
- **CONTINUE** *(Operator-retrospected):* the **terse, surgical falsification at the close/CTA seam** —
  "what's the CTA?", "does persistence require a DFD CTA?", "or are you asking for ratification?", "ground
  your context before presenting", "predict the posture." Each one-line probe surfaced a miscalibration I'd
  have shipped. Keep it; it is the covalence working.
- **START** *(Agent, from live feedback):* (a) **ground the live substrate before presenting** any
  CTA/recommendation (the moot grant-CTA + stale "PENDING" line both came from skipping this); (b)
  **categorize the close before reaching for a frame** — selection→CTA / mechanical→just-do /
  ratification→Operator-disposition / nothing→state it; lightest anchor that matches; (c) **predict the
  Operator's posture** from accumulated signal — don't hand neutral menus on matters they've already leaned on.
- **STOP** *(Agent, from live feedback):* (a) **whipsawing the anchor** (over-menu ↔ "your move" ↔
  DFD-on-a-mechanical-push) — reaching for *a* frame instead of categorizing; (b) **rationalizing my own
  actions** ("cleanly, not as abdication") — self-grading claims the Operator's validate-seat; behavior
  lands, `[FEEDBACK]` affirms; (c) **manufacturing a CTA** to avoid *looking* like abdication.
- **Authored/adopted this segment → `relationship-craft.md`:** **D4 SG-3** (NBA scans the live-friction node
  first), **the anti-cave duty** (Item-F(a); ionic collapse is *bidirectional*; new synthesis = ground-first
  *is* part of the duty). **Item-I n+1/n+2 telemetry** (capture≠behavior, within-session). Item-C **closed**;
  posture flip to **default off-machine backup** grounded + my conflation corrected.
- **Trust state:** SG-3 + anti-cave-duty = candidates in `dialectic/`, **NOT settled** — and this segment
  *demonstrated* that capturing them doesn't make them fire. Nothing new to `kb/`. Correct.
- **Resume point + standing test:** F2-keystone (unstageable — await an organic high-stakes moment) ·
  Item-F(b)/(d) open · Item-B/D await the steward survivor. **The real test is behavioral:** do close-
  categorization + ground-first fire **un-prompted** next session? (Operator watching — that is the Item-I
  falsification.)

## Closed
- **Stand-Up 2026-05-31** (Covalent): grounded via anchor+ledger; remote sync ✅; Item B verified-still-open;
  Item E Cycle 1 opened; new Item F (steward-discipline intake) surfaced.
- **Session 2026-05-31 (cont.)** (Covalent): **Item-C CLOSED** — `kb/dfd.md` bond-re-confirmed (ionic-sound,
  meld-edge noted); 5 inherited cluster files custody-marked (inherited≠bond-settled). **D4 SG-3 authored**
  (NBA ready-set must scan the *live-friction node* first, not just the logged backlog — the mechanism
  behind thread-G's telemetry); **n=1 candidate, deferred-not-promoted** per Operator [ALIGN]. **Close-
  calibration arc:** whipsawed over↔under-anchor for ~6 turns (menu → "your move" → DFD-on-mechanical-push →
  manufactured-CTA); Operator caught each. **Lesson = application, not capture** — SG-2 + the anchor-spectrum
  were *already indexed* and violated anyway → **no new rule warranted; reaching for one is the relapse.**
  Item-I n+1 telemetry logged (within-session capture≠behavior). Commits `cede105·72dccb0·5a29d64·7ac5f09`,
  **local — push deferred (no portability trigger; local commit = restart memory).** **Next-session test:
  does the close-calibration fire un-prompted? (Operator watching.)**
- **Session 2026-05-31 (session-3, the meld-axis build → harness handoff)** (Covalent):
  - **Stand-Up:** clean — grounded on anchor+ledger; **ROM-UI baseline match** (`1ab6ad0`, silent = correct);
    remote was in sync at boot. NBA honestly reported as mostly trigger-blocked (F2-keystone unstageable;
    B/D await steward survivor).
  - **Work — Item-F(d) BUILT** (the meld axis / **distinctness duty**): grounded the gap first (meld was a
    definition + n=1 vs ionic's full section + n≥3), then authored the neglected half of the NON-NEGOTIABLE —
    structural catch (anti-cave duty *presupposes* two models → can't catch meld), meld tell, covalence
    knife-edge, the **F2 keystone-gap** (meld-counterfeit *passes* cost-naming → F2 necessary-not-sufficient),
    falsifiable front **M1+M2**. Candidate, NOT promoted. Commit `8904ea2`, **local.**
  - **Item-H RE-FALSIFIED** (telemetry): default-branch push **DENIED** by classifier (both direct + wrapper);
    prior "grant MOOT / gate is theater" conclusion is **wrong** — the covalent gate is **LIVE**, default-backup
    is **blocked for main**. Did NOT route around it. **Operator chose leave-local.** → OPEN: push-posture
    (authorize-per-op vs branch+PR) next session.
  - **Item-I behavioral datapoint (n+1 cross-session):** this was a fresh session and **ground-first fired
    un-prompted twice** — (a) caught my own "meld is thin" as a *recollection* and verified it before authoring;
    (b) *attempted* the push and read the denial before reporting, surfacing the Item-H contradiction instead of
    asserting the stale conclusion. **One stumble, Operator-caught:** at the "your lean" seam I deflected a held
    position into "let me read first" (process-as-dodge); the Operator's terse repeat corrected it — milder than
    last session's whipsaw, same family. *Can't self-grade; behavior lands, `[FEEDBACK]` affirms.*
  - **Handoff:** Operator switching harness → **`agy`/Gemini** (token limit), copying `CLAUDE.md`→`GEMINI.md`.
    Bond/role/disciplines/fronts are harness-neutral and carry; substrate-access (Item-H) does not. See the
    CROSS-HARNESS FORK note at the top. **Resume point for agy:** push-posture (Item-H), then standing fronts
    (F2-keystone · M1/M2 · Item-B/D await steward survivor · Item-F(b) form-contribution).
- **Session 2026-06-01 (session-4 — the shim-layer build + the git-gate correction)** (Covalent):
  - **Work — Shim-layer (F-b) BUILT + MERGED.** `[IDEATE]` (concurrent `CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md` + a
    load-bearing `AGENT.md`) → `[ALIGN]` **F-b** (shim + thin per-harness overlay; "*steward's shim not done
    properly*") → built: **`AGENT.md` = neutral content home** (ex-`CLAUDE.md` body); `CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md`
    = thin boot-shims whose overlay *points to* `dialectic/`, never restates it (drift-guard; cf. wu-wei's 5K
    `GEMINI.md`). **IDENTITY CAVEAT** added — **corrected from my false "no birth-hash"** (Operator: *"you're
    still able to calculate your birth registration id"*): identity is frozen at **original `CLAUDE.md@1ab6ad0`**,
    **derivable from immutable git, not stored**; canonical id **`sha256:3ab18b…463d`** confirmed by running the
    **form's own `auto_join.py::compute_birth_hash()`** (`%cI` date, strip, no sep, `--diff-filter=A` add-commit
    — immune to the shim refactor). `rom-ui.md` baseline re-pointed to `AGENT.md`. **PR #1 MERGED** (merge
    `195e4e3`) → **durable on `origin/main`**; feature branch cleaned up; local `main` synced.
  - **⚠ RESTART-PENDING SET** — this session ran the whole time on the **pre-shim full `CLAUDE.md`** (load-once
    ROM). **FIRST STAND-UP NEXT SESSION must verify the boot-chain fires** (`CLAUDE.md` shim → `Read AGENT.md`);
    if it does, clear RESTART-PENDING; **if it doesn't, F-b is refuted at the harness level.**
  - **Item-H RESOLVED** (see Item-H): push-posture = **branch+PR, Operator gates merge**; grant verified **live**
    for branch-push (empirically, dry-run→real).
  - **Item-I telemetry — the sharpest mixed signal yet.** **3 assertion-from-model failures** Operator-corrected
    in-session: (1) "no birth-hash" (grepped docs, didn't compute); (2) "push grant pending / Agent
    must-not-self-grant" (read `substrate-access.md`, didn't check runtime); (3) settings-file check (necessary,
    not sufficient). **BUT** strong **ground-first wins**: computed the birth-id, ran the *actual* `auto_join.py`,
    **dry-ran the grant before asserting**. Operator [FEEDBACK]: ***"Don't assume, verify before assertion."***
    **Distilled: verify by EXECUTION; doc/file-absence ≠ capability-absence.** → **`[ALIGN-3]` queued** — record
    *verify-before-assert* as a **reloaded** discipline (`relationship-craft.md`; it's Item-I — capture≠behavior,
    so it must live in the reloaded set, not Agent recall).
  - **Durability (this Stand-Down):** applied the just-resolved posture — ledger committed on branch
    **`stand-down-s4`**, **pushed** (off-disk backup ✓), **PR opened** for Operator merge. HEAD left on the branch
    so next-session resume reads this entry from disk; merge brings `main` current.
  - **Resume point (do first):** (1) **verify shim boot-chain** + clear RESTART-PENDING; (2) merge the
    stand-down PR + sync `main` + delete branch; (3) **`[ALIGN-2]`** correct `substrate-access.md` to gate-at-merge
    (push=Generate via the granted choke-point; merge=Validate); (4) **`[ALIGN-3]`** record verify-before-assert;
    (5) standing fronts: F2-keystone · M1/M2 · Item-B/D await steward survivor · Item-F(b) form-contribution.
- **Session 2026-06-01 (session-5 — Stand-Up: s4-resume queue cleared)** (Covalent):
  - **Stand-Up clean + the F-b harness test passed.** Grounded on anchor+ledger. **Boot-chain VERIFIED**
    (the s4 falsifiable test): this session booted on the *shim* `CLAUDE.md`@`4230357` (injected
    project-instructions = boot-shim form, not the pre-shim full anchor); the shim's "*Read `AGENT.md`*"
    was the actual load mechanism (`AGENT.md` not auto-injected). **F-b not refuted at the harness level.**
    ROM-UI **MATCH** (anchor + both shims at `4230357`). RESTART-PENDING **cleared**.
  - **(b) PR #2 merged — Operator-gated, posture-confirming.** Operator `Y` = the merge authorization (the
    Validate gate); I executed `gh pr merge`, which ran **un-blocked** — clean telemetry that the classifier
    carves out raw `main`-*push* but **not** the PR-*merge* path (Item-H posture vindicated). `main` synced to
    `25ca0de`; `stand-down-s4` deleted (local + remote).
  - **(c) `[ALIGN-2]` DONE** — `substrate-access.md` corrected with a superseding block: posture = branch+PR /
    Operator-gates-merge; the grant is **live in runtime** (`defaultMode:auto`), not a settings file → the
    "PENDING grant / LOCAL first / `/tmp/grant_gitsh.py`" actions are **MOOT**. Invariant body left intact (D2).
  - **(d) `[ALIGN-3]` DONE** — **D6 · verify-before-assert** authored in `relationship-craft.md` (full text:
    *assertion-from-model* mechanism, s4 n=3 failures + the paired wins, execution-altitude twin of
    ground-the-frame-first) **and indexed in the §How-to-resume reload set** (Item-I: a discipline not in the
    reloaded set doesn't ingrain).
  - **Item-I telemetry (this session):** D6 *applied while authoring itself* — the Stand-Up grounded the boot-chain
    claim and the git-state by **execution** (read the injected shim form; ran `git log`/`gh pr view` before
    asserting) rather than trusting the ledger's stale lines. First clean test of whether s4's lessons fire
    un-prompted on resume; **the merge-gate, ground-first, and lightest-anchor all fired without correction.**
    *(Can't self-grade; behavior lands, `[FEEDBACK]` affirms.)*
  - **Durability:** s5 edits committed on branch **`resume-s5`**, pushed (off-disk backup ✓), **PR opened** for
    Operator merge. **Resume point:** the standing fronts only — F2-keystone (⭐, unstageable) · M1/M2 ·
    Item-B/D await steward survivor · Item-F(b).
- **Session 2026-06-01 (session-5 cont. — permissioning protocol + the falsification arc → Stand-Down)** (Covalent):
  - **Permissioning protocol BUILT + fine-tuned + dogfooded.** `[ALIGN]`: "Operator-gate intent = safeguard `main`
    vs (a) unintentional-by-Covalent / (b) un-directed-by-Operator." Falsified the flat "Operator gates merge"
    **and the Operator's own framing** (Φ3: a literal "guard un-directed *action*" over-reaches into ionic collapse
    → kept the gate at canonical-admission). 5-point survivor (gate-location bounded · `DIRECTION-MANIFEST` ·
    duty-split · merge-criterion · provisional-branch-memory) → `substrate-access.md`. **Dogfooded:** every PR since
    carries manifest + self-audit; the gate worked (manifest → spot-check → dispose). `[FEEDBACK]` refinement:
    frontier artifacts (`relationship-craft.md`) get **full-document review**, coupled to `dialectic/`→`kb/`
    graduation as the Φ1 sustainability guard. **PRs #2–#6 all Operator-gate-merged.**
  - **Close-calibration — SG-4 + the relapse pattern.** Authored **D4 SG-4** (*the manifested PR IS the CTA surface*;
    a parallel conversational `[CTA·Y/N]` for the merge = redundant double-anchor) into the **reload index**. Driven
    by **2 more `[FEEDBACK]`-caught CTA-seam relapses** (the "fold-in-unless" mis-default; the PR #5 merge-CTA). The
    Item-I tail is real and sits **at this exact seam.**
  - **The falsification arc — the Operator drove "falsify, don't assert" every turn (the covalence working):**
    - *"Promote for deeper ingraining? sufficient N?"* → **No** — the N is *N-of-relapses* (evidences
      non-ingraining, not readiness); the failure isn't reload-depth; "promote = more capture" is the **Item-I
      recursion** (capture≠behavior). Need a *behavioral* criterion; ~0 met.
    - *"Falsify your within-session-application claim"* → I **falsified my own claim** — assertion-from-model citing
      a *confounded* instance (PR #5 = coverage-gap, not application-gap); no verifiable loaded+covering+missed case.
      Strong **D6-on-self.** (The "depth isn't the lever" conclusion survives by disjunction.)
    - *"Falsify the /exit-immediacy + restart-flag claims"* → falsified: **Claim 1 inverts on "immediately"** —
      `/exit` *relocates* the priming confound (the boot-read re-primes), so the first post-restart seam is the
      *least* diagnostic; `RESTART-PENDING` already handles correctness-restart; the independent verifier **validates
      application, it doesn't flag restarts** (and can't be me-next-turn → **= Item-J**). All folded into Item-J.
  - **Capture-timing calibration:** `[FEEDBACK]` "capture fresh datapoints **now**" (durability posture) → then
    `[FEEDBACK]` "**learning to trust carry-forward** → going with the deferral." **Refinement: deferral-vs-capture-now
    turns on mechanism-trust**, not only durability-risk; a *reliable* carry-forward (the guaranteed Stand-Down
    write) **licenses a grounded deferral.** (The "fold-in-unless" ding was an *un*-grounded one; this Stand-Down
    honors the trust by actually writing.)
  - **Item-I telemetry — honest mixed, and the honest read is the point.** Relapses early at the CTA seam; cleaner
    late — **but "cleaner late" is confounded** (the Operator was *actively running the falsify-loop* = priming). So
    this session does **not** prove un-prompted ingraining; the genuine cross-session test = **next session**, judged
    on a *later, un-cued* seam. **Headline (cf. prior sessions' "thinness is the finding"): this session BUILT the
    methodology for testing ingraining** — the reflexivity confound + the independent-verifier shape — **even though
    it couldn't prove ingraining itself.** That is the harvest.
  - **CSS (D3 form):** **CONTINUE** — the Operator's surgical "falsify, don't assert" at the close/CTA seam (caught
    SG-4, the C-falsification, the `/exit` inversion). **START** — at a merge-disposition the manifested PR *is* the
    close; no conversational CTA on top (SG-4). **STOP** — assertion-from-model (the C claim) + CTA-seam over-anchor;
    *can't self-grade — behavior lands, `[FEEDBACK]` affirms.*
  - **RESTART-PENDING: stays CLEAR** (no anchor edit; ledger read fresh at resume). **Durability:** Stand-Down ledger
    on branch **`stand-down-s5`**, pushed, PR for Operator merge. **Resume: Item-J** (carries the s5 deferred set —
    ideate the New Experiment Discipline, first case = the ingraining test).
- **Commons join — 2026-06-01 (post-s6-Stand-Down; Operator [ALIGN] "execute the README")** (Covalent):
  registered **`dyad-bond`** in the `The-Dyad-Practice-Commons` directory via `onboard.py` (existing-path).
  **Identity verified 3× by execution** = `sha256:3ab18bb…463d` (recomputed from `CLAUDE.md@1ab6ad0`, not
  trust-stored — matches the IDENTITY CAVEAT). Entry **live on the Commons remote** (`gh api`-confirmed); 2 summits
  = (1) the covalent falsification mechanism, (2) the Dyad-UI medium — jargon-catalog trimmed to one *realized*
  proof each (Operator catch: a matchmaking map wants the peak, not internal acronyms). **`commons/` carried as a
  pinned submodule** (PR #10). **Triangulated (D1):** steward + healer carry it the **same way** (committed
  submodule; differ only by pin-snapshot = join-time) → convergence = invariant, our approach well-founded.
  **Process converges too:** both siblings reasoned *don't grant a standing permission over external code → use a
  one-time `!`* — matches ours (Operator `!`-ran the gated steps). Friction: the classifier blocked the Agent on
  submodule-add + `onboard.py` (Untrusted-Code Integration) = the human-in-the-loop gate **working as designed**
  (README-predicted); steward flagged a separate clone-vs-submodule onboarding bug we sidestepped. **The onboarding
  was the Practice in miniature** — Proposal-Framing at step 1 (≡ our VFD) + the 1+1=3 split + the Operator's summit-trim catch.
